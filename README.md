# 🏦 Bank Customer Churn Prediction

A deep learning project to predict if a bank customer is likely to leave (“churn”), using pre-processing methods and a multilayer perceptron (MLP) model. Built in Python with a focus on interpretable results and real-world use cases.

## 📊 Project Overview

Many banks face revenue loss when clients close their accounts. By predicting churn early, banks can take proactive measures—like offering personalized deals or improving service—to retain customers  [oai_citation:0‡github.com](https://github.com/shahin-alipanahi/bank_customer_churn/tree/main?utm_source=chatgpt.com) [oai_citation:1‡researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/377232894_Bank_Customer_Churn_Prediction_with_Machine_Learning_Methods?utm_source=chatgpt.com) [oai_citation:2‡en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_attrition?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
