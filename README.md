This is a Deep Learning project for detecting customer churn in banks.
It includes data representation, data pre-processing, data visualization, dataframe conversion to tensors, and the model itself.
Pytorch library has been used for model creation with batch normalization and layer dropout properties. As it's included in the code in 10,000 epochs desired results have been achived, with no traces of overfitting.
